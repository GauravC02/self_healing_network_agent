# Self-Healing Network Agent Project Report

## Abstract

This project implements an intelligent self-healing network agent that leverages Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to autonomously monitor, identify, and resolve network issues. The system continuously analyzes network performance metrics, detects anomalies, and executes appropriate healing actions to maintain optimal network health. Through reinforcement learning, the agent learns to make decisions that maximize long-term network performance and reliability, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention in network management.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Modern network infrastructures face increasingly complex challenges in maintaining optimal performance and reliability. Traditional network management approaches often require manual intervention, leading to slower response times and potential human errors. This project addresses these challenges by implementing an autonomous self-healing network agent that can continuously monitor, detect, and resolve network issues without human intervention.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Develop an autonomous network monitoring system that continuously tracks performance metrics
- Implement intelligent problem detection using DQN to identify network anomalies
- Create automatic healing mechanisms for various network issues
- Optimize network performance in real-time through adaptive learning
- Provide comprehensive logging and visualization of network states

### 1.3 Motivation and Significance

The increasing complexity of modern networks demands more sophisticated management solutions. Manual network management is becoming increasingly inefficient and error-prone. This project's self-healing agent represents a significant step toward autonomous network management, offering:
- Reduced downtime through proactive issue detection
- Improved network reliability through automated healing actions
- Decreased operational costs by minimizing manual intervention
- Enhanced network performance through continuous optimization
